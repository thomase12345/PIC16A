Spotify recommender app
This project takes a user's music data from Spotify using the spotipy library and compiles a webpage where they can view their top tracks and genres, receive recommendations based on their top tracks, and search up songs they wish to receive recommendations for. To run this project requires some setup through Spotify API, where one needs to create an app and receive credentials to run the code (a client id and client secret id). The libraries listed in requirements.txt must be installed as well. After that, one can execute the app.py through the terminal and receive a redirect URL, which can be pasted into a browser, where the user will be prompted to sign in. After that, setup is complete and the webpage will be accessed. Unfortunately, due to recent limitations on Spotify data collection*, some compromises on the project had to be made, such as not being able to directly incorporate song features into the recommendation algorithm (since song features can no longer be extracted from each song through Spotify API/spotipy). The app features a genre-based song recommender, which gives the user recommended songs based on the genre's of their top songs. The song recommender prompts the user to search for a song, and this feature was trained on a large dataset of around 160,000 songs and their audio features. The limiting factor however is that the dataset is from 2020, so many newer songs can't be used as the prompt in this feature.
